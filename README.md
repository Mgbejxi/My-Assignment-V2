#### Challenge - 2

#### Challenge - 3
> In `src/assignment.js`, implement the `celsiusToFahrenheit` function. Convert the array of numbers representing temperatures in Celsius, to an array of temperatures in Fahrenheit. Decimal figures in the converted values in Fahrenheit should be removed. E.g 51.21 should just be 51 (hint: Math.trunc(...) function)
 See https://www.thoughtco.com/celcius-to-farenheit-formula-609227 for the conversion formula. If you did Challenge - 3, remove the comment in the line just after the `celsiusToFahrenheit` function, otherwise leave the comment.
